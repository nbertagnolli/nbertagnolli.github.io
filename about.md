I am currently a Principle Machine Learning Engineer at BENLabs.

Previously I was th CAIO and founder of [Mpathic](www.mpathic.ai).  I invented some methods for using LLMs to improve human communication along with my CoFounder Dr. Grin Lord.  I've spent a lot of time thinking about the intersection of NLP and mental health. I built out the original models for <a href="http://www.lyssn.io">Lyssn</a> as their first engineer.  If we're talking way back in time I was a Data Scientist working for 3M HIS where I leveraged large quantities of healthcare data to improve hospitals, and patient care.

I graduated from the School of Computing at the University of Utah with an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics where I conducted research with Dr. Orly Alter in the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.alterlab.org">Genomic Signal Processing Lab</a>

My current research deals with Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.  You can
