I am currently a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="http://www.lyssn.io">Lyssn</a> where I work on teaching machines how to help therapists be their best selves.

Previously I was a Data Scientist working for 3M HIS where I leveraged large quantities of healthcare data to improve hospitals, and patient care.

I graduated from the School of Computing at the University of Utah with an M.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics where I conducted research with Dr. Orly Alter in the <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.alterlab.org">Genomic Signal Processing Lab</a>

My current research deals with Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.  You can
