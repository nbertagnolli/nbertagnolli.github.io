## **What is Matrix Sketching?**
Matrix sketching is a method of preserving some aspects of a large matrix in a much smaller one.
For example, take some very large matrix $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$$ where $$n$$ or $$d$$
or both are huge and represent it as a smaller matrix $$B \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell\times m}$$ such that
$$\|A - B\|$$ is small.  If you are familiar with the SVD an easy way to accomplish this would be
to take the SVD and find the best rank-$$k$$ approximation of $$A$$ denoted $$A_k$$.  The problem 
here is sometimes we want guarantees on this approximation matrix but we don't want the expensive
$$\mathcal{O}(nm\text{ min}(n,m))$$computation of the SVD .

## **Frequent Directions to the Rescue!** 
Frequent Directions (FD) addresses both of these issues.  FD is an algorithm invented by 
<a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/el327/">Edo Liberty</a>.  
It adapts the well known frequent items algorithm to matrices and provides some excellent 
guarantees on the relationship between the original matrix $$A$$ and the sketched matrix 
$$B$$.  More formally, the algorithm takes in a stream of $$A$$'s rows and maintains a
sketch of a matrix $$B$$ with $$\ell << m$$ where:\begin{align}
B^TB \prec A^TA \text{ and } ||A^TA-B^TB||_2 \leq 2||A||_f^2/\ell
\end{align}
The matrix $$B$$ can also be obtained in $$\mathcal{O}(\ell m)$$ time and space.  Which is 
considerably better than SVD. For a derivation of this bound and its complexity see the 
original paper <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/el327/papers/simpleMatrixSketching.pdf">PDF</a>.

## **Experiments**
I wanted to see for myself that the above bound holds in practice. To do this I performed FD on a matrix 
$$M\in \mathbb{R}^{10000\times 100}$$ for $$\ell = \{50, 55, ..., 100\}$$ and graphed the upper bound
and $$||A^TA-B^TB||_2$$ in Figure 1.  Indeed we see that $$||A^TA-B^TB||_2 \leq 2||A||_f^2/\ell$$

Next I wanted to see that FD is faster than SVD so I fixed $$\ell = 75$$, $$n = 100$$, and varied 
$$m$$ from $$10000$$ to $$100000$$.  The results are displayed in Figure 2.
